A NMEA Wifi hub and data acquisition system for small boats.

Using an ESP32 system on a chip as the central controller, sensors and data sources will be broadcast over WiFi using the NMEA protocol. An addition controller drives an ePaper display for use as an ondeck sunlight readable display. Using NMEA based mobile application, the data and signals can integrated. For example GPS and AIS streams can be used to drive a chart plotter.

The diagram below shows the system in overview.
